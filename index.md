His eyes met mine as he scoffed, “It’s just videos. It’s not like it’s real or anything.

The 9/11 terrorist attacks brought on financial losses that caused insurers and Congress to reevaluate how the United States approaches terrorism risk coverage. Congress quelled concerns of insurers evading coverage of future terrorist attacks by enacting the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act in 2002. This Note considers the difficulties presented by the out-of-date language employed by Congress in 2002 and proposes amendments so that the Act more clearly covers acts of cyberterrorism, which are ever-growing in their destructive potential.

The notions of organized crime and terrorism have an old and rich history around the globe. Researchers and practitioners have been studying events and phenomena related to these notions for a long time. There are pointers in the literature in which it is misleading to see the unfair comparison between terrorist and criminal networks with the argument that all actors involved in these networks are simply evil individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Blockchain, or “distributed ledger technology” (DLT), has been devised as an alternative to the law of finance. While it has become clear by now that regulation in the public interest is necessary—for example to avoid money laundering, drug dealing, or tax evasion—the particularly thorny issues of private law have been less discussed. These include, for instance, the right to reverse an erroneous transfer, the ownership of stolen coins, and the effects of succession or bankruptcy of a bitcoin holder. All of these questions require answers from a legal perspective because the technology does not answer them.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Many online chat applications live in a grey area between the legitimate web and the dark net. The Telegram network in particular can aid criminal activities. Telegram hosts “chats” which consist of varied conversations and advertisements. These chats take place among automated “bots” and human users. Classifying legitimate activity from illegitimate activity can aid law enforcement in finding criminals. Social network analysis of Telegram chats presents a difficult problem. Users can change their username or create new accounts. Users involved in criminal activity often do this to obscure their identity. This makes establishing the unique identity behind a given username challenging. Thus we explored classifying users from their language usage in their chat messages.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In Industry of Anonymity: Inside the Business of Cybercrime, Jonathan Lusthaus attempts to demystify the increasingly sophisticated business of cybercrime and examine how it has matured into a large, profit-driven industry. Through interviews with hundreds of subjects involved in the cybercrime industry in varying capacities, Lusthaus has sought to draw a map that, by showing how seemingly disparate elements in the industry relate to one another, can better explain how the cybercrime industry functions. In particular, Lusthaus strives to produce a better understanding of the people behind cybercrime and the contexts in which they operate. By doing so, the book endeavors to lift the veil of anonymity that has historically hidden cybercrime offenders and their activities from public view.
